# Apache Pulsar Ruby client

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "pulsar-client", "~> 2.6.1.pre"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pulsar-client --pre

Note #1: You will need libpulsar (for linking) and libpulsar-dev (for
C++ client header files, for compiling) installed first. For both, the
Gem currently targets version 2.6.1. If your libpulsar is older, it will
fail to compile. If it is newer, it _might_ compile is not guaranteed.

Note #2: This is a pre-release version of this Gem. You will need the
`--pre` flag to `gem install` to install it manually, and must include
the `.pre` suffix in the Gemfile to install it via Bundler.

## Usage

Setup and basic `consumer.receive` example:

```ruby
# use a standard Pulsar client config (see https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/conf/client.conf)
# export PULSAR_CLIENT_CONF=/path/to/your/client/conf/client_conf.conf
# OR, if not present have these in your shell with appropriate values
# export PULSAR_BROKER_URI=pulsar://your-pulsar-broker:6651
# export PULSAR_CERT_PATH=/path/to/your/pulsar-ca.pem
# export PULSAR_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token

# create client using values from environment
client = Pulsar::Client.from_environment

# produce a message on the "hello-world" topic in the "namespace"
# namespace of the "tenant" tenant
topic = "tenant/namespace/topic"
producer = client.create_producer(topic)
producer.send("Hello, world!")

# consumer that message from the topic with an exclusive subscription
# named "hello-consumer"
subscription = "hello-consumer"
consumer = client.subscribe(topic, subscription)

msg = consumer.receive
message = msg.data
puts "got #{message}"
consumer.acknolwedge(msg)
```

Convenience method for listening to messages in a loop:

```ruby
consumer.listen do |message, _, done|
  # process message here; call done to stop the loop.
  # messages are auto-acknowledged.
  puts "got #{message}"
  done.call()
end
```

Convenience method for listening on a separate thread:

```ruby
listenerThread = consumer.listen_in_thread do |message, _, done|
  # process message here; call done to stop the loop.
  # messages are auto-acknowledged.
  puts "got #{message}"
  done.call()
end
# ...
listenerThread.join # wait for the thread to finish
```

(more documentation coming; see TODO.md)

## Development

If your ruby is not already compiled with `--enable-shared`, you'll need
to rebuild it. Example for rbenv:

```
CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" rbenv install <your ruby version>
```

If you don't already have them installed, you need libpulsar and
automake for the compilation and linking to work. Example with brew:

```
brew install libpulsar automake
```

Next, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies -- Rice in particular.
Once that successfully completes, you can `rake compile` to build the
extension. It is then ready to use locally.

You can run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will
allow you to experiment. You can also run `rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`.
